The assignment:  Create a fun and interactive game for web browsers that must dynamically update your HTML pages with the jQuery library.

The Application Game:  Crystal Collectors

Crystal Collectors is a game where a player is given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystal images whereby clicking on a crystal will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

A player wins the game by matching his/her total score to the random number. The player loses the game if his/her total score goes above the random number.

NOTE:  The value of each crystal is hidden from the player until a crystal is clicked.

Each time the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
